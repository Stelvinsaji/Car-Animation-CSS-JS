Project Description:

Implemented a Car using Html & CSS with sound effects.The prerequisites of this project are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Explanation:

Sky: I have placed the sky such that it covers the full viewport by assigning it 100vw and 100vh and we have set the position to absolute.

Trees: I have positioned the tree such that it occupies the bottom of the webpage by using position: absolute property.

Track: I have positioned the track to the bottom of the webpage, and we have repeated the track in the x-direction such that it always remains visible in the animation. 
We have also assigned a very large width to the track too for the same purpose. 
Now, the animation applied to the track moves the track in the backward direction such that it appears that the car is moving.

Carwheel: I have positioned the car and its wheels to their desired positions first and then made the wheels rotate by applying proper animation to it.
